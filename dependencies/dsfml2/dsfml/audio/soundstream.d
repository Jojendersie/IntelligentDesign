/++
 + Abstract base class for streamed audio sources.
 + 
 + Unlike audio buffers (see SoundBuffer), audio streams are never completely loaded in memory.
 + 
 + Instead, the audio data is acquired continuously while the stream is playing. This behaviour allows to play a sound with no loading delay, and keeps the memory consumption very low.
 + 
 + Sound sources that need to be streamed are usually big files (compressed audio musics that would eat hundreds of MB in memory) or files that would take a lot of time to be received (sounds played over the network).
 + 
 + SoundStream is a base class that doesn't care about the stream source, which is left to the derived class. SFML provides a built-in specialization for big files (see Music). No network stream source is provided, but you can write your own by combining this class with the network module.
 + 
 + A derived class has to override two virtual functions:
 + 		- onGetData fills a new chunk of audio data to be played.
 + 		- onSeek changes the current playing position in the source
 + 
 + It is important to note that each SoundStream is played in its own separate thread, so that the streaming loop doesn't block the rest of the program. In particular, the OnGetData and OnSeek virtual functions may sometimes be called from this separate thread. It is important to keep this in mind, because you may have to take care of synchronization issues if you share data between threads.
