 + Base class defining a sound's properties.

 + SoundSource is not meant to be used directly, it only serves as a common base for all audio objects that can live in the audio environment.
 + 
 + It defines several properties for the sound: pitch, volume, position, attenuation, etc. All of them can be changed at any time with no impact on performances.
